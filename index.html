    <p id="starInfo">Also known as the North Star (as well as the Pole Star, Lodestar, and sometimes Guiding Star),
        Polaris is the 45th
        brightest star in the night sky. It is very close to the north celestial pole, which is why it has been used as
        a
        navigational tool in the northern hemisphere for centuries. Scientifically speaking, this star is known as Alpha
        Ursae
        Minoris because it is the alpha star in the constellation Ursa Minor (the Little Bear). It’s more than 430
        light-years away from Earth, but its luminosity (being a white supergiant) makes it highly visible to
        us here on Earth. What’s more, rather than being a single supergiant, Polaris is actually a trinary star system,
        comprised of a main star (alpha UMi Aa) and two smaller companions (alpha UMi B, alpha UMi Ab). These, along
        with its
        two distant components (alpha UMi C, alpha UMi D), make it a multistar system.

        Interestingly enough, Polaris wasn’t always the north star. That’s because Earth’s axis wobbles over thousands
        of years
        and points in different directions. But until such time as Earth’s axis moves farther away from the “Polestar”,
        it
        remains our guide.

        Because it is what is known as a Cepheid variable star – i.e. a star that pulsates radially, varying in both
        temperature
        and diameter to produce brightness changes – it’s distance to our Sun has been the subject of revision. Many
        scientific
        papers suggest that it may be up to 30% closer to our Solar System than previously expected – putting it in the
        vicinity
        of 238 light years away.</p>
