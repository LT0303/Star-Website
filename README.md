# Star-Website

This is a small project to exercise what I've learned so far
with HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. I aim to create a responsive
page about different stars in space that involves the use of
Flexbox, semantic HTML, and a simple interface where users can learn
more about a set of notable stars through prompts.
