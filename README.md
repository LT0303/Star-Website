# Star-Website

This is a small project to exercise what I've learned so far
with HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. I aim to create a responsive
page about different stars in space that involves the use of
Flexbox, semantic HTML, and a simple interface where users can learn
more about a set of notable stars. I aim to further
practice using git with a remote repository from my local machine,
including setting up a remote through git bash and GitHub's website.

After learning some more JavaScript, specifically events, I now also
aim to use events to add interactivity directly to the page itself,
mainly using click event listeners and manipulating DOM objects like
text and images to facilitate users' progress through the page.

After finishing this project, I was able to practice using and
implementing the following things:

- Creating a mobile-first design and using media queries to
  implement responsive design for tablets and desktops
- Using flexbox controls to arrange elements and vw, em, and %
  based sizing to allow for responsiveness
- Using several CSS properties and selectors, including
  situational ones for hovering over buttons and transitions
  for background color
- Using semantic HTML and ids to clearly markup sections
- Using JavaScript event handlers and listeners, as well
  as DOM manipulation, to change the innerText and HTML of
  the page in response to user input
- Creating functions and objects to streamline JS function
  callbacks
- Using objects and arrays nested in a parent object and
  accessing those via variables in a callback
- Manipulating specific attributes like image sources and alt
  text
- Using Chrome DevTools to test CSS properties and reference
  that to implement, change, or remove properties, as well as
  debug JS errors re: event handlers not changing the DOM
  correctly
- Learning to have hyperlinks break and wrap correctly w/ CSS
- Learning to specify local image file paths in JS
- Using a remote to add, commit, and push changes to a GitHub repo,
  and creating meaningful commit messages
