# Star-Website

This is a small project to exercise what I've learned so far
with HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. I aim to create a responsive
page about different stars in space that involves the use of
Flexbox, semantic HTML, and a simple interface where users can learn
more about a set of notable stars. I aim to further
practice using git with a remote repository from my local machine,
including setting up a remote through git bash and GitHub's website.

After learning some more JavaScript, specifically events, I now also
aim to use events to add interactivity directly to the page itself,
mainly using click event listeners and manipulating DOM objects like
text and images to facilitate users' progress through the page.
