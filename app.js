        info: `<p>Also known as the North Star (as well as the Pole Star, Lodestar, and sometimes Guiding Star), Polaris is the
        45th brightest star in the night sky. It is very close to the north celestial pole, which is why it has been used
        as a navigational tool in the northern hemisphere for centuries. Scientifically speaking, this star is known as
        Alpha Ursae Minoris because it is the alpha star in the constellation Ursa Minor (the Little Bear).</p> <p>It’s more than 430
        light-years away from Earth, but its luminosity (being a white supergiant) makes it highly visible to us here on Earth.
        What’s more, rather than being a single supergiant, Polaris is actually a trinary starsystem, comprised of a main star
        (alpha UMi Aa) and two smaller companions (alpha UMi B, alpha UMi Ab). These, along with its two distant components
        (alpha UMi C, alpha UMi D), make it a multistar system.</p> <p>Interestingly enough, Polaris wasn’t always the north star. That’s 
        because Earth’s axis wobbles over thousands of years and points in different directions. But until such time as Earth’s axis 
        moves farther away from the “Polestar”, it remains our guide.</p> <p>Because it is what is known as a Cepheid variable star – i.e.
        a star that pulsates radially, varying in both temperature and diameter to produce brightness changes – it’s distance to our 
        Sun has been the subject of revision. Many scientific papers suggest that it may be up to 30% closer to our Solar System than 
        previously expected – putting it in the vicinity of 238 light years away.</p>`

        info: `<p>Also known as the Dog Star, because it’s the brightest star in Canis Major (the “Big Dog”), Sirius is also the brightest star 
        in the night sky. The name “Sirius” is derived from the Ancient Greek “Seirios“, which translates to “glowing” or “scorcher”. Whereas 
        it appears to be a single bright star to the naked eye, Sirius is actually a binary star system, consisting of a white main-sequence 
        star named Sirius A, and a faint white dwarf companion named Sirius B.</p> <p>The reason why it is so bright in the sky is due to a combination 
        of its luminosity and distance – at 6.8 light years, it is one of Earth’s nearest neighbors. And in truth, it is actually getting closer. 
        For the next 60,000 years or so, astronomers expect that it will continue to approach our Solar System; at which point, it will begin to 
        recede again.</p> <p>In ancient Egypt, it was seen as a signal that the flooding of the Nile was close at hand. For the Greeks, the rising of 
        Sirius in the night sky was a sign of the”dog days of summer”. To the Polynesians in the southern hemisphere, it marked the approach of 
        winter and was an important star for navigation around the Pacific Ocean.</p>`

        brightest star in the night sky. It is also the closest star system to Earth, at just a shade over four light-years. But much like Sirius 
        and Polaris, it is actually a multistar system, consisting of Alpha Centauri A, B, and Proxima Centauri (aka. Centauri C).</p> <p>Based on their 
        spectral classifications, Alpha Centauri A is a main sequence white dwarf with roughly 110% of the mass and 151.9% the luminosity of our Sun. 
        Alpha Centauri B is an orange subgiant with 90.7% of the Sun’s mass and 44.5% of its luminosity. Proxima Centauri, the smallest of the three, 
        is a red dwarf roughly 0.12 times the mass of our Sun, and which is the closest of the three to our Solar System.</p> <p>English explorer Robert Hues 
        was the first European to make a recorded mention of Alpha Centauri, which he did in his 1592 work Tractatus de Globis. In 1689, Jesuit priest 
        and astronomer Jean Richaud confirmed the existence of a second star in the system. Proxima Centauri was discovered in 1915 by Scottish astronomer 
        Robert Innes, Director of the Union Observatory in Johannesburg, South Africa.</p> <p>In 2012, astronomers discovered an Earth-sized planet around Alpha 
        Centauri B. Known as Alpha Centauri Bb, it’s close proximity to its parent star likely means that it is too hot to support life.</p>`

        info: `<p>Pronounced “Beetle-juice” (yes, the same as the 1988 Tim Burton movie), this bright red supergiant is roughly 65o light-year from Earth. Also 
        known as Alpha Orionis, it is nevertheless easy to spot in the Orion constellation since it is one of the largest and most luminous stars in the night 
        sky.</p> <p>The star’s name is derived from the Arabic name Ibt al-Jauza’, which literally means “the hand of Orion”. In 1985, Margarita Karovska and colleagues 
        from the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, announced the discovery of two close companions orbiting Betelgeuse. While this remains unconfirmed, 
        the existence of possible companions remains an intriguing possibility.</p> <p>What excites astronomers about Betelgeuse is it will one day go supernova, which is 
        sure to be a spectacular event that people on Earth will be able to see. However, the exact date of when that might happen remains unknown.</p>`

        brightest star in the night sky. Here too, what appears to be a blue supergiant is actually a multistar system. The primary star (Rigel A) is a blue-white 
        supergiant that is 21 times more massive than our sun, and shines with approximately 120,000 times the luminosity.</p> <p>Rigel B is itself a binary system, consisting 
        of two main sequence blue-white subdwarf stars. Rigel B is the more massive of the pair, weighing in at 2.5 Solar masses versus Rigel C’s 1.9. Rigel has been 
        recognized as being a binary since at least 1831 when German astronomer F.G.W. Struve first measured it. A fourth star in the system has been proposed, but it 
        is generally considered that this is a misinterpretation of the main star’s variability.</p> <p>Rigel A is a young star, being only 10 million years old. And given its 
        size, it is expected to go supernova when it reaches the end of its life.</p>`

        and the second brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere (after Arcturus).</p> <p>Characterized as a white dwarf star, Vega is roughly 2.1 times as massive as 
        our Sun. Together with Arcturus and Sirius, it is one of the most luminous stars in the Sun’s neighborhood. It is a relatively close star at only 25 light-years 
        from Earth.</p> <p>Vega was the first star other than the Sun to be photographed and the first to have its spectrum recorded. It was also one of the first stars whose 
        distance was estimated through parallax measurements, and has served as the baseline for calibrating the photometric brightness scale. Vega’s extensive history of 
        study has led it to be termed “arguably the next most important star in the sky after the Sun.”</p> <p>Based on observations that showed excess emission of infrared 
        radiation, Vega is believed to have a circumstellar disk of dust. This dust is likely to be the result of collisions between objects in an orbiting debris disk. 
        For this reason, stars that display an infrared excess because of circumstellar dust are termed “Vega-like stars”.</p> <p>Thousands of years ago, (ca. 12,000 BCE) Vega 
        was used as the North Star is today, and will be so again around the year 13,727 CE.</p>`

        the most apparent, the cluster actually consists of over 1,000 confirmed members (along with several unconfirmed binaries).</p> <p>The core radius of the cluster is about 
        8 light years across, while it measures some 43 light years at the outer edges. It is dominated by young, hot blue stars, though brown dwarfs – which are just a 
        fraction of the Sun’s mass – are believed to account for 25% of its member stars.</p> <p>The age of the cluster has been estimated at between 75 and 150 million years, and 
        it is slowly moving in the direction of the “feet” of what is currently the constellation of Orion. The cluster has had several meanings for many different cultures
